My website for all my programming, blogging, and work needs.

Thanks to [Programming Historian's](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/building-static-sites-with-jekyll-github-pages) online tutorials for helping me create this website and to the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) community for its great static site generating capabilities.
