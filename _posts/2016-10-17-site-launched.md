Well, I finally got around to using Jekyll for my website and this will be my very first blog post, corresponding with my first year here at UCI. Using Jekyll, I can write my blogs in Markdown and keep parts of my website static (ex. nav bar, footer).

{% include update.html
    number="1"
    content="<p>Just wanted to list the classes I'm taking this semester.</p><ul><li>CSE 41 - Intro to Programming (in Python)</li><li>Physics 7C/7LC - Classical Mechanics</li><li>Math 2D - Multivariable Calculus</li><li>ICS 90 - Intro to Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) at UCI</li></ul><p>That's it! (I know, lots of math...)</p>" %}
