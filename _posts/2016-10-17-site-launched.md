Well, I finally got around to using Jekyll for my website and this will be my very first blog post, corresponding with my first year here at UCI. Using Jekyll, I can write my blogs in Markdown and keep parts of my website static (ex. nav bar).

## Update #1
Just wanted to list the classes I'm taking this semester.
	* CSE 41 - Intro to Programming (in Python)
	* Physics 7C/7CL - Classical Mechanics
	* Math 2D - Multivariable Calculus
	* ICS 90 - Intro to Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) at UCI
That's it! (I know, lots of math...)
