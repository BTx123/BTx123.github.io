Well, I finally got around to using Jekyll for my website and this will be my very first blog post, corresponding with my first year here at UCI. Using Jekyll, I can write my blogs in Markdown and keep parts of my website static (ex. nav bar).

## Update #1
Just wanted to list the classes I'm taking this semester.
* CSE 41 - Intro to Programming (in Python)
<ul>
	<li>Physics 7C/7CL - Classical Mechanics</li>
	<li>Math 2D - Multivariable Calculus</li>
	<li>ICS 90 - Intro to Information and Computer Sciences (ICS) at UCI</li>
</ul>
	
That's it! (I know, lots of math...)
