So, putting behind the extra charge for lab equipment that was just added this last week...my lab partners and I actually did a lab today in physics! Woohoo! Using two _____ and a low-friction track, we calculated energy added or removed from the system using the Work-energy Theorem (for those of you who are curious, [here is the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_%28physics%29#Work.E2.80.93energy_principle)).
