So, putting behind the extra charge for lab equipment that was just added this last week...my lab partners and I actually did a lab today in physics! Woohoo! Using two photogate timers and a low-friction track, we calculated energy added or removed from the system using the Work-energy Theorem (for those of you who are curious, [here is the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_%28physics%29#Work.E2.80.93energy_principle)). The lab was actually pretty interesting, especially the near-frictionless surface of the air-blowing track.

I also attended a Git(Hub) workshop with few of my [VGDC](http://vgdc-uci.com/) buddies so that we could all learn (or for me, refresh) Git's version control capabilities.

Last but not least, I had my second midterm ever here at UCI for CSE 41. It was a walk in the park by APCS standards, but a good review of what we've been doing in Python so far.

Until next time,<br/>
Brian
