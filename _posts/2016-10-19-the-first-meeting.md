Or, more specifically, the first team meeting for the VGDC game development group for "The Last Robot." After 4 weeks of preparation and adapting to college life, I will be hosting the first of many team meetings in the Student Center (who knew they had private, reservable study rooms, called CSLs?) for our game. I am Project Lead for a team of 7 developers: 4 programmers, 2 artists, and 1 writer (plus an Officer Buddy who will be helping us make sure we have a successful game). At tonight's meeting, we will discuss the schedule for the rest of the quarter, develop a concrete background story, assign jobs to each person, and make sure everyone knows how to use Git.

Every Wednesday I have a seminar P/NP class called ICS 90 that gives us Freshman (and others who are interested) a look into the lives of professionals in computer science. Today, the presentations were about machine learning in autonomous vehicles and natural language processing. [Amelia Regan](http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/aregan/) was the presenter for Computer Science in Transportation, who focuses on developing algorithms for logistical issues faced by transportation networks, specifically truckers (who have very difficult and dangerous jobs). [Sameer Singh](http://sameersingh.org) works on natural language processing algorithms to better connect the tasks of AI, artificial intelligence, to our natural languages. He also uses algorithms to process and translate words to and from different languages, demoing the process of splitting up the sentence into phrases, translating individual phrases into the target language, and then making combinations of all possible sentences to determine which best fits the intended meaning.

Oh, and I just finished all my midterms for the time being &mdash; just waiting for that second round...

## Update #1
So, that meeting I was talking about earlier. Well, it took longer than I expected. 3 hours to be exact, from 7PM - 10PM. Whew, that was a long day! ...and I've still got more work to do.
