Or, more specifically, the first team meeting for the VGDC game development group for "The Last Robot." After 4 weeks of preparation and adapting to college life, I will be hosting the first of many team meetings for our game in the Student Center (who knew they had private, reservable study rooms, called CSLs?). I am Project Lead for a team of 7 developers: 4 programmers, 2 artists, and 1 writer (plus an Officer Buddy who will be helping us make sure we have a successful game). At tonight's meeting, we will discuss the schedule for the rest of the quarter, develop a concrete background story, assign jobs to each person, and make sure everyone knows how to use Git.

If you would like to check out how our team is doing, visit our [GitHub repo for "The Last Robot."](https://github.com/BTx123/VGDC_TheLastRobot)

Oh, and I just finished all my midterms for the time being &mdash; just waiting for that second round...

Thanks for reading,<br/>
