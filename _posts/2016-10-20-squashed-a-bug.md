No, it wasn't an *actual* bug. Nope, not the crawling kind like that poor moth above. It was a bug in the Unity game I am currently working on. By using Visual Studio's debug and error windows, I found an 'Array Out of Bounds' error which was linked to the player health script. For reasons unknown (as of yet), the sprites for health were unlinked from the main camera which displays the images. After adding the sprites back in, the game was back in working order and I could continue working on the player's movement (since it isn't that smooth yet).

Today was also the Fall Career Fair. Though I could only go for the last hour, my friends and I quickly realized that most companies did not feel very comfortable with hiring freshman, which is entirely reasonable. Oh well, after freshman year I guess, when we'd call ourselves 'sophomores.'

Chicken Pho for dinner was very delicious. I could smell the pho soup even before I entered The Anteatery (Dining Commons).

Have a good night (or morning)!<br>
