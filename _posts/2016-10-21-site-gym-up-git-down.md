Hooray! I registered my personal domain name [briantom.me](http://briantom.me/) yesterday and it is up and running. [GitHub's Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) provided my with a free domain name for a year hosted by [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) so I was able to redirect my previous site name (BTx123.github.io) to this new one. The pack is not limited to just personal domains though, it also offers access to AWS Cloud, private repos on GitHub, a nanodegree program offered by Udacity, and Unreal Engine.

Today, there was a [DDoS attack on Dyn servers](https://www.dynstatus.com/incidents/nlr4yrr162t8), so no GitHub :( for most of the day. The issue was resolved by about 3PM (PST) but that prevented me from pushing updates to this site and to our game for the morning and afternoon. I still had cached versions of my site so I was able to use [Stylebot](http://stylebot.me/about) to edit the CSS for my site. Multiple sites besides GitHub were affected as well, including Reddit, New York Times, Amazon, Twitter, and Spotify.

Let's end with a positive note. Just this week (Wednesday to be exact), the gym at Mesa Towers, which are the new freshman dorms, opened its gym. As you can see above, there aren't that many people using it at 10AM in the morning, possibly because most people have classes or there's not too much equipment to use. I, however, found it very convenient and felt that the machines and weights there were enough for most of the residents here. It's still new so students may take awhile to hit the new gym.

Good day to you,<br>
Brian
