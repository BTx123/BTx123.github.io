Today's gonna be a short one. Coding takes lots of energy...

On the topic of coding, I fixed Issue #1 for our game. It was a simple boolean expression error returning the wrong boolean value causing the player to face the wrong direction. So glad I've fixed that now; I can focus on smoothing out the player's movement and adding the attack animations.

Since today is Saturday, I also went for my weekly long run. Today's run was just around the UCI campus, about 2.1 miles. It also gave me an opportunity to but some groceries at Trader Joe's. Yum.

Stay focused,<br>
Brian
