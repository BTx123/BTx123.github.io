Today's weather was as if I were back home. The sky was dark and gloomy as rainfall began and thunder roared from miles away. I took to the shelter of my dorm, classrooms, and the gym to get out from the cold, wet air. Winter is coming (I hope you're a GoT fan; if not go watch it :D).

Brandywine Commons always has a daily special. Today's was Fried Spam Musubi, instead of the usual non-fried musubi. Of course, most fried things taste good, and this was no exception (though the seaweed could have been a little crispier). There were also 2 sauces on it: spicy mayo and teriyaki sauce.

Have a good meal,<br>
Brian
