This evening our VGDC team held our second meeting at Nina's apartment (thanks for inviting us over!). We went over our progress for each task.

* AI is still a WIP, since it's actually pretty difficult to code well
* Player scripts are essentially finished, physics may need a little tweaking
* Player animations, however, need to e implemented once we have the sprites next week
* Concept art for the player, level 1 enemies, and level 1 environment have been drawn out
* HUD is coming together nicely
* Story is constantly changing and adapting to the artstyle

So that just about summarizes our completed tasks. Next week, we'll hopefully have a very simple demo of enemies and level design.

And we coded poop to damage the player...

Good night,<br>
Brian
