Whew!

Just finished my first year at UCI with 4 finals -- 3 written tests and 1 essay. Overall, I felt pretty confident with each of my finals but I won' know the results until next week.

My past year at UCI has been filled with all types of people and exciting activities -- from the 4-team dodgeball game to my fist hackathon, HackUCI -- I had lots of fun, though some classes were still difficult and not that exciting.
