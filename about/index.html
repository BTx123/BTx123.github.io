        Hi, my name is <strong>Brian Tom</strong> and I am an aspiring software developer with an interest in the hands-on, engineering side of things (hence the 'E' in 'CSE'). I found a passion for computer science during my sophmore year of high school when I found some online coding courses. I took a beginning programming course in Javascript and then the AP Computer Science course. Project-based learning helped me develop the fundamentals of computer programming and are what inspired me to keep working on a project even when they became very complex. From then on, I was determined to change the world through technology, but not without first exploring the engineering side through my high school's robotics team, <a href="www.team4159.org">Cardinalbotics</a>. Participating in <a href="http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST</a> is an experience I will never forget. From the people I met, to the robots we built, I was surrounded by people who have a passion for promoting the STEAM field. I was even lucky enough to attend the FIRST World Championships in St. Louis with my team as we competed in the Galileo Division.

        My hometown, 'The City by the Bay,' is San Francisco. I lived there until I went off to college in Irvine. I enjoy traveling around the world, experiencing new cultures, listening to music, hitting the <a href="http://www.campusrec.uci.edu/">ARC</a> (gym), and eating new foods.
