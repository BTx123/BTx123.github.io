    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
        *UC Irvine student by day, gamer/hobbyist game developer by night*<br>
        I am an aspiring software developer with an interest in the hands-on, engineering side of things (hence the 'E' in 'CSE'). I found a passion for computer science during my sophmore year of high school when I found some online coding courses. I took a beginning programming course in Javascript and then the AP Computer Science course. Project-based learning helped me develop the fundamentals of computer programming and are what inspired me to keep working on a project even when they became very complex. From then on, I was determined to change the world thorugh technology, but not without first exploring the engineering side through my high school's robotics team, [Cardinalbotics](www.team4159.org). Participating in [FIRST](http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc) is an experience I will never forget. From the people I met, to the robots we built, I was surrounded by people who have a passion for promoting the STEAM field. I was even lucky enough to attend the FIRST World Championships in St. Louis with my team as we competed in the Galileo Division.
