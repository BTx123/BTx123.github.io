I poured batter to about 3/4 of the way up the springform pan, then poured the rest into muffin tins about 2/3 of the way up. In total, the recipe is enough for one cheesecake and 9 mini cheesecakes.</p>\n<h2>Tools</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>9 in springform pan</li>\n<li>Large bowl</li>\n<li>Parchment paper</li>\n<li>Measuring cups</li>\n<li>Measuring spoons</li>\n<li>Spatula</li>\n<li>Sifter</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Ingredients</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>unsalted butter (for pan)</li>\n<li>2 lb cream cheese, room temperature (leave on countertop, at least 2 hours)</li>\n<li>1 1/2 cup sugar</li>\n<li>6 large eggs</li>\n<li>2 cup heavy cream</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>\n<li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>\n<li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Steps</h2>\n<h3>Batter</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Beat cream cheese and sugar together until all the sugar is dissolved and cream cheese is smooth.</li>\n<li>Add eggs one at a time until barely mixed, then add cream, salt, and vanilla and mix until combined.</li>\n<li>Sift the flour in two batches into the batter.
