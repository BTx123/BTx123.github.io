Remove from heat and let cool, then store in bowl for later.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Dough</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Mix oil-flour ingredients into paste and set aside.</li>\n<li>Sift all-purpose flour and stir in salt.</li>\n<li>Stir in hot water, adding more 1 teaspoon at a time (if necessary) until a dough ball forms. The dough should not be sticky.</li>\n<li>Let rest covered for 30 minutes or up to 2 hours at room temperature. The dough will be more hydrated and smooth if you let it rest longer.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Pancakes</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Divide dough into 8 pieces and cover until ready to use.</li>\n<li>On a lightly oiled surface, roll out one piece of dough into a square as thin as you can (about 8 inches on the side).</li>\n<li>Brush oil-flour mixture on top (you don't need too much!) and sprinkle about 2 tablespoon of chopped scallion, leaving some space on the edges.</li>\n<li>Roll up dough into a log, then roll log into pinwheel and cover to rest as you work on the other pieces of dough.</li>\n<li>Repeat steps 2-4 until all 8 pieces of dough are pinwheels.</li>\n<li>Flatten the pinwheels with your palm and roll out to about 6 inches in diameter. Store separated by parchment or plastic wrap to prevent it from sticking to the other pancakes.</li>\n<li>Repeat previous step for all pinwheels.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Cooking</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Preheat a nonstick skillet on high with 2 tablespoon of oil.</li>\n<li>Lower heat to medium once hot and put pancake into skillet, cooking each side for 1-2 minutes until golden brown.</li>\n<li>Remove pancake fom skillet onto paper towel and scrunch up once cooled slightly to ensure flakiness.</li>\n<li>Repeat for all pancakes, adding oil as needed. Without oil, the dough will have dark spots instead of browning, which is not what you want.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Serving</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Serve immediately with dipping sauce on the side.</li>\n</ol>"}},"pageContext":{}},"staticQueryHashes":["3435614192","347271685"]}
